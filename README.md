## Yuanqing Wang

By day, I'm a Ph.D. candidate in [John D. Chodera Lab](choderalab.org) at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](mskcc.org), where I'm interested in using graph neural modeling to facilitate all asepcts of drug discovery---from statistical to physical. When night falls, I write experimental short stories at the [City College of New York](ccny.cuny.edu).
